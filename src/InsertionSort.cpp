/*
 * Time Complexity:
 *   Best Case: O(n)
 *   Worst Case: O(n^2)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * Advantages:
 *   In-place: constant memory usage.
 *   Stable: maintains the relative order of equal elements.
 *   Adaptive: performs better on almost sorted data.
 *   Can sort data as it receives it.
 * Disadvantages:
 *   Quadratic time complexity.
 *   High memory access cost due to the swaps.
 * Applications:
 *   Sorting a stream of data
 *     (e.g. keyboard strokes, bank transactions, web apps).
 *   Small datasets.
 *   Almost sorted data.
 *   Complex sorting algorithms use it for small subarrays.
 *   Stable sorting requirement.
